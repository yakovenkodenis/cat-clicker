# Cat Clicker
The app is created for the purposes of learning MVC architecture and better code organisation in JS applications.
It is incredibly simple and basically has the collection of cats with their names and photos.
It counts and prints every user's click being made for each cat's photo. Each cat has its own number of clicks.

  
| Branch  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| _master_  | **VanillaJS version.** The app stores the state of every cat in the localStorage and has the admin panel for updating things.  |
| _knockout_  | **KnockoutJS version.** No localStorage or admin panel, just basic functionality. |
